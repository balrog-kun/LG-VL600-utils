This little repo holds the userspace utilities needed to connect
and disconnect from the Verizon 4G network using their VL600
mobile modem usb dongle, made by LG Electronics.  The kernel
patch to enable actual network communication is also in this
repository until it finds its way upstream, once it works
reliably.

The scripts also need to be cleaned-up, the protocol needs more
researching and finally the userspace part should all be integrated
into projects like oFono, connman, NetworkManager, etc. so that
no scripts are needed.

vl600-attach.py makes the dongle connect to the network.
vl600-detatch.py disconnects from network before the dongle
  is removed from USB port (not sure this is needed, but just
  in case) -- re-attaching without unpluggin the dongle doesn't
  usually work, yet.
vl600-com.py gives you a AT commands terminal for talking to
  the modem.  Honestly it's quite useless because the modem
  firmware's idea of "AT commands" is so far from 3GPP standards,
  there's practically no command that works correctly on this
  modem.
